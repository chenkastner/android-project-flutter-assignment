## HW 3 - Dry Questions

1. The class that is used to implement the controller pattern in `snapping_sheet` library is the `SnappingSheetController`.
It allows us to change the current snapping position, stop the snapping and get current position.

2. The parameter that controls the bottom sheet to snap into position with various different animations is snappingPositions and its properties snappingCurve and snappingDuration.

3. `GestureDetector`'s advantage over `InkWell` is that it has a greater variety of gestures it controls, such as `onLongPressStart`, `onScaleUpdate` etc, that `InkWell` doesn't control.
   `InkWell`'s advantage over `GestureDetector` is that InkWell includes ripple effect tap.
